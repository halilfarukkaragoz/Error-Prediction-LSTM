# Error-Prediction-LSTM

## Toyota Internship Project
This repository contains the code for the Toyota internship project in the robotic branch. The project focuses on using robot feedback data from sensors and failure cases to develop a sequential deep learning model using LSTM. The model achieved an accuracy of 95% in predicting failure cases.
* The data directory contains CSV files that store the robot feedback data.
* The scripts directory includes the model description, training scripts, and data preprocessing code.

## Summary
The Toyota internship project in the robotic branch aimed to leverage robot feedback data from sensors to predict failure cases. Using LSTM, a sequential deep learning model, we achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 95% in identifying potential failures. The project's directory structure includes the data directory, which holds the CSV files with the feedback data, and the scripts directory, which contains the model description, training scripts, and data preprocessing code.
